# Emojify
In this, I have built 2 models: 1 with simple embeddings, and other with (1) incorporated by 2 LSTM's and Dropout layer. Both these models takes input a sequence of words and outputs Emoji most relevent to the sentence. Clearly, (2) performs much better as it takes into account the order of words, (1) just predicts an emoji based on the words used.
